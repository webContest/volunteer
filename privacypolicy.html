                <h1>Donor Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p class="pp_list">GreenSpeak Georgia values and respects its donors’ right to privacy. It affirms that its fundraising practices protect against unauthorized use of its contributor lists, and permits no general telephone solicitation of the public.<br>
          
                  <br>GreenSpeak Georgia utilizes donors’ personal information such as names, mailing addresses and email addresses only for purposes of donor acknowledgement and/or when an individual voluntarily provides this information and opts to join our mailing list. GreenSpeak Georgia does not share donors’ personal or contact information with any third party organizations for purposes of solicitation.<br>
                  
                  <br>For purposes of individual donor acknowledgement, GreenSpeak Georgia releases donor names, contact information and donation amounts to those GreenSpeak Georgia participating organizations that are designated by our donors, and only with the written consent of our donors. GreenSpeak Georgia strives to ensure that all donors who request acknowledgment receive appropriate acknowledgment in an orderly, timely and effective manner from the managing federation (either an GreenSpeak affiliate or chapter, or the national office) and the recipient member charity (for designated gifts).<br>

GreenSpeak Georgia’s online donors choose the personal information that GreenSpeak Georgia receives and can opt to remain anonymous. All credit card transactions are conducted over a secure server.<br>

                  <br>Due to the rapidly evolving technologies on the Internet, we may occasionally update this policy. All revisions will be posted to this site. A revised Privacy Policy will apply only to data collected subsequent to its effective date.<br>
